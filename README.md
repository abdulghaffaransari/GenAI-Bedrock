# **RAG-Driven RainAI**  
## **A Cutting-Edge Rainfall Prediction and Retrieval-Augmented Generation System**

### **Overview**  
**RAG-Driven RainAI** is a state-of-the-art **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** models and advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to:  
1. Predict **rainfall amounts** using historical weather data.  
2. Extract, retrieve, and answer questions from large volumes of research documents, such as PDFs, with high precision.  

The system integrates **machine learning regressors**, modern vector search tools, and language models to deliver intelligent, contextual answers and precise rainfall predictions.

## **Key Features**  
- **Machine Learning-Based Rainfall Prediction**:  
   - Implements **10 supervised regression models** to predict the rainfall amount (in mm) based on historical weather datasets.  
   - Delivers accurate performance metrics using **Random Forest Regressor** as the top-performing model.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:  
   - Combines **information retrieval** from PDF documents and **AI-based generation** to provide concise, accurate answers.  
   - Employs vector embeddings for semantic search using **FAISS** and **Amazon Bedrock** services.

- **Document Querying System**:  
   - Ability to upload PDF files, vectorize the content, and retrieve answers to user queries.

- **End-to-End Integration with Streamlit**:  
   - User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction with the model and document retrieval system.

## **System Architecture**  
1. **Document Processing Pipeline**:  
   - PDF files are loaded and split into chunks using **LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.  
   - Text embeddings are generated using **Amazon Titan Embeddings**.  
   - Chunks are stored and indexed using **FAISS** for semantic retrieval.

2. **RAG Pipeline**:  
   - User queries are vectorized and matched against stored document embeddings.  
   - Top matching contexts are fed into the **Amazon Bedrock LLM** to generate accurate answers.

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:  
   - Historical weather datasets are preprocessed and fed into **10 regression models**.  
   - Models are evaluated, and predictions are provided using the best-performing regressor (**Random Forest**).

4. **Web Interface**:  
   - Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for uploading PDFs, generating vectors, querying documents, and visualizing predictions.
